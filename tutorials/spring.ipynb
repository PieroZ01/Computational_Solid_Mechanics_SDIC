    "## Spring Elements Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show the typical workflow of solving a spring elements problem using the CSM (Computational Solid Mechanics) framework. As we will see, the framework allows to easily define the problem and solve it quickly in very few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The spring element is a simple one-dimensional element that connects two nodes. The spring has a stiffness `k` and can be compressed or stretched. As the spring element has only two degrees of freedom (DOFs), one at each node, the element stiffness matrix is a 2x2 matrix defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k_{el} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "k & -k \\\\\n",
    "-k & k\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for a problem consisting of a system of spring elements with `n` nodes, the global stiffness matrix `K` will be a `n x n` matrix. The global stiffness matrix is assembled from the element stiffness matrices and has to be symmetric and positive definite. Once the global stiffness matrix is assembled, the following system of equations is obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K \\cdot U = F\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `U` is the global nodal displacement vector and `F` is the global nodal force vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "After imposing the boundary conditions, the system of equations can be solved for the unknown nodal displacements. The element forces can then be computed using the element stiffness matrix and the nodal displacements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will solve a simple problem consisting of two spring elements connected in series. The first element has a stiffness of `k1 = 100 kN/m` and the second element has a stiffness of `k2 = 200 kN/m`. The system is subjected to a total force of `F = 15 kN` at the free end of the second element. The first node is fixed, and the second node is free."

To do this, we can use the `set_external_constraints` method, which takes a list as input. Each element of the list is the index of the node that is fixed. In this case, we will set the first node (index 0) as fixed. The method will also partition the global stiffness matrix `K`, removing the rows and columns corresponding to the fixed node.
